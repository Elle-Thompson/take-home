# Available Tasks

Please review this document, along with the document that was shared with you via e-mail. The document in e-mail will
have a table of proposed tasks we'd like to see you tackle.

## Before, during, after

This exercise has multiple parts:

1. Read existing code
2. Choose some tickets
3. Write some code
4. Record and share with us your thought process.

Please time-box this project, personally I'd recommend two to three hours to get through at least some tasks, if not most.

### Before

Once you've had a chance to get this repo set up, have gone through the available "tickets" and chosen some, record your
initial thoughts and impressions.

Note that each task will have an associated "Priority", where higher the priority the more important it is. The
allocated "Story Point" column should help indicate the _difficulty_ of the task, not necessarily the _time_ required.

Please write down and share with us which tasks you initially chose to do, and how you made that decision.

### During

Refer to your provided doc in your email, and use both the [api](api.md) doc and [resources](resources.md) files as
references.

You may get stuck, that's okay. I'd suggest avoid spinning your wheels on any single task.

Write down why you think you got stuck, and maybe try a different task.

### After

Now that you've had some time on your chosen tasks, write down how you think it went.

* What went well?
* What didn't go so well?
* Run into anything unexpectedly?
* Anything you'd change?
* Write freely about your experience and the process as a whole.
* How much time did you spend?

Afterwards, check your code into your forked Github repository, and reply to your e-mail with the details and include
your notes.
